## Best practices of AWS
1. You need to design for failure, but nothing will fail.
2. It’s important to decouple all your components before using AWS services.
3. You need to keep dynamic data closer to compute and static data closer to the user.
4. It’s important to know security and performance tradeoffs.
5. Pay for computing capacity by the hourly payment method.
6. Make a habit of a one-time payment for each instance you want to reserve and to receive a significant discount on the hourly charge.
